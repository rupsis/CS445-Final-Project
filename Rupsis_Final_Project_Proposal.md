# CS 445 - Final Project Proposal

## 3D reconstruction with Blender


### Motivation 
For my final project, I'm choosing to work on 3D image reconstruction. Before becoming a software engineer, I was pretty heavily involved in the Blender community, and almost went down the path to become a professional Animator. I'm hoping with this project I can get back into the wonder world of blender, and learn how to programming in it. 


### Milestones 
* Being able to programmatically generate mesh inside of blender
* Explore the "tour into the picture" methods to be able to recreate the algorithm.
* FIgure out how to programmatically transfer 2D information to 3D space in blender
* (Time permitting) Explore some other 3D reconstruction methods (foreground object detection, etc)


### Evaluation
The evaluation for the 3D reconstruction will be pretty easy, considering I'm trying to recreate the image. The results will basically speak for themselves. But a good metric of success would be being able to create a believable 3D scene / animation from a 2D image.  


### Resources 
* Blender (Free, open source)
* Any image

I've already downloaded blender. Besides that, I just need python, and some images, and I should be good to go!


### Group
This will be a solo project
